      Blue Stars are a short 5 minute PvP battle in which five players and/or AI controlled battleships fight
      till the last ship standing. The star is filled with cerbs and continuously collapses.

      If a ship enters the center sector of the star, it will inflict 150 damage every second. The outer blue ring
      shows where the star has collapsed up to. Anything that goes past the blue ring dies instantly. The red zone
      signifies how far the star will collapse and everything inside the zone as it collapses dies instantly. You can
      tell it your ship or other ships are in the red zone or not by a little dot in the center of the ship.


      Each day, you can earn rewards from playing blue stars. Winning first place with a non-sanced ship awards
      you 90% of the ships and mod cost. If you lose with a non-sanced ship, you will be refunded 90% of the rebuild
      cost back so if you win 1/10 blue stars, you will break even. You can also earn 25% of your hydrogen storage
      with sanced or non-sanced ships so it is recommended that you use a non-sanced ship to earn the daily credit
      reward and then use a sanced ship to earn the rest of the hydro.


      Players will also earn star fragments while playing which can be used to climb the bls leaderboards and can
      also be used for the shipment relay station. A bls season lasts one month and players are rewarded crystals at
      the end of the season for placing on the leaderboards and for reaching a certain amount of fragments. Players
      that place in 1st, top ten, and top 50 also earn nifty distinctions that go permanently on their profile.


      Tactics:


      The best strategy is to AVOID ALL ENGAGEMENTS until absolutely necessary. The point of blue stars is to come
      out on top as the last survivor. Hugging the edge and avoiding cerbs and/or other battleships will keep your
      ship healthy and happy.


      Luring/pointing cerbs is a nice and easy way to save health and clear a sector. To lure, simply move into a
      sector one ring before the zone closes. The cerbs will come towards you and will die instantly as they move
      outside the zone.

      To point, set your ship's course to the asteroid closest to the ring/in the red zone. Make sure your ship
      doesn't depart on its course. You may have to cancel the course and repeat it until the cerb decides to move.
      (Pointing doesn't work on interceptors)

      Once you reach the final circles things get intense. For one, the lone battleship may have called all his
      interceptor friends but decided to leave making you the host for their party. Avoiding contact still applies
      here. Try to stay away from activated interceptors and find an asteroid close to the center sector to
      position your ship at. Set the longest course possible across the center sector to help you survive longer.
      Remember that asteroids in the red zone will disappear when they circle collapses so you may have to set your
      course early. Use any remaining mods to kill other ships and keep yourself alive as long as possible.


      At the end, when there are no asteroids remaining, destiny will act like a mini emp,  keeping you from going
      out of bounds longer. It can also be used at this stage to break a Bond on your BS, keeping your ship in place
      until the end of the Blue Star.


      Weapons:

      🐋 Weak Batt, Mass Batt, and Barrage aren’t viable.

      🐋 Dual Laser is viable and is nice for multiple targets.

      🐋 Batt and Laser are the most viable weapon options as they deal the most damage in most circumstances.


      Shields:

      🐋 Don't use Area or Blast shield

      🐋 Alpha and Delta shields aren't viable as they do not offer much hp.

      🐋 Passive shield is a decent shield that doesn't add extra hydro expense

      🐋 Mirror Shield can be a viable shield but must be upgraded to a decent level and is costly to activate.

      🐋 Omega Shield is your best bet for protection as it offers the most hp and requires less hydro to activate than mirror.


      Support Mods:

      🐋 Do not use Red Star Life Extender, Unity, or Leap.

      🐋 Stealth, Fortify, Impulse, Suppress, Delta Rocket, Alpha Drone, and Vengeance can be viable but there are better options to fill those precious mod slots.

      🐋 EMP - One of the best mods for bls it offers a good variety of uses from trapping enemies in the collapsing zone to keeping yourself alive longer in the final circles.

      🐋 Teleport - Another really useful mod. Can be used to send interceptors to other players and as a quick way of getting around. Can be paired up with bond and destiny.

      🐋 Remote Repair - Good for extra health to keep you alive longer.

      🐋 Time Warp - Viable as it speeds shield cool-down allowing for second shield pops late game and cutting emp time in case you're trapped in the red zone. Also good for getting around quickly.

      🐋 Alpha Rocket - A nice way of clearing a cerb swarm or knocking chunks of enemy health away.

      🐋 Salvage - Good for regaining health and allows you to pop shield later.

      🐋 Destiny - Allows you to deal a decent amount of damage to enemies and get away in a pinch. Just be careful cause you may end up in the red zone or in a cerb infested sector disabled for a few seconds.

      🐋 Barrier - Much weaker in bls because of shortened time but still viable to keep ships in the red zone or away from you.

      🐋 Bond - A nice way to push enemies outside the zone. Can be paired with teleport nicely.

      🐋 Omega Rocket - Only a few people have this mod unlocked but I'm guessing it's definitely viable because of the massive damage it deals.
